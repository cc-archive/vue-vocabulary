For example usage, go through the source code of the components
[Tabbed](#/Layouts/Tabbed) and [Navigation](#/Patterns/Navigation).

Since the above table does not mention it, `SlotComponent` takes a `default`
slot containing the content to show if the passed component (`component` prop) 
does not populate the passed slot (`name` prop).
