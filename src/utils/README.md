Utils are programs, components, functions that exist to serve other programs,
components and functions. They have very little to no significance standing
alone but they provide essential and indispensable functionality to the latter.


### Working with utils

Utils may be plain JavaScript files indicated by the `.js` extension, Vue 
components indicated by the `.vue` extension or something else. There is no
clearly definition as to what exactly constitutes a util except that on their
own, they have no significance.
