In essence Vue Vocabulary is a collection of UI components that incorporate Vocabulary under the hood.
Vue Vocabulary makes it easier to develop Creative Commons apps while ensuring a consistently familiar experience.


### Availability

Vocabulary is available as
- [stylesheets](https://github.com/creativecommons/vocabulary)
- Vue components _(this repo)_


### Demo

The showcase of the true extent of Vocabulary can be found in the
**[interactive storybook](https://cc-vue-vocabulary.netlify.com/)**
for the library, showcasing the components therein and variants thereof, on GitHub
Pages. Search for a particular component using the search field or just explore
the collection of components. If you find one that catches your fancy, play with
it on the playground and tweak its knobs.

If it works for you, just pick the code and use it in your own application. If 
it doesn't and you think more people would love to have this feature open an 
issue. If something peculiar happens, open a bug report. If you just love it,
contribute in some way.
