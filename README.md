In essence Vocabulary is a collection of UI components, which are parts of 
web sites and web apps that have significance as being individual units that
can be mixed, matched, styled and put together to quickly and effectively 
develop consistent applications.


### Availability

Vocabulary is a collection of UI components, available both as 
**CSS stylesheets** and **minified JS** distributed via unpkg, as well the more
versatile and flexible (and preferred) **Vue components** distributed via `npm`.
A lot of features available via `npm` packages might not be supported via UMD.


### Demo

The showcase of the true extent of Vocabulary can be found in the
**[live styleguide](https://creativecommons.github.io/cc-vocabulary/styleguide)**
and the
**[interactive storybook](https://creativecommons.github.io/cc-vocabulary/storybook)**
for the library, showcasing the components therein and variants thereof, on GitHub
Pages. Search for a particular component using the search field or just explore
the collection of components. If you find one that catches your fancy, play with
it on the playground and tweak its knobs.

If it works for you, just pick the code and use it in your own application. If 
it doesn't and you think more people would love to have this feature open an 
issue. If something peculiar happens, open a bug report. If you just love it,
contribute in some way.

| **Design**    | If you are a designer, your inputs on making every component more intuitive, aesthetic and joyful will reverberate through the entire ecosystem. |
| **Test**      | If you are a user of these components, your feedback, bug reports and feature requests will drive the project forward so that we can meet your needs. |
| **Translate** | If you speak a language other than, and in addition to, English, you can help make the project accessible to your community with your words. |
| **Write**     | If you have a knack for writing technical articles, you could be the voice of the library's documentation, making it easy to use and understand. |
| **Share**     | If you can't contribute in these ways, you can refer the project to a friend who might be able to. Spreading the word is the easiest way to help out. |
